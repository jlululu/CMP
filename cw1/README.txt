Activity 1: 
a simple eCommerce system, which allows the user to:
  • A - allows the user to add a product to the cart (see the example in Listing 2);
  • R - allows the user to remove an existing product from the shopping chart (see Listing 3);
  • S - the script prints out a summary of the cart, along the lines of the example in Listing 4;
  • Q - the user can change the quantity of a product already present in the cart;
  • E - the script generates a summary of the cart as JSON, printed to the console. The JSON
  output is an array of JSON products (see the example in Listing 5);
  • C - at any moment, allows the user to interrupt the shopping session. The program will print
  out the following message: “The current operation is cancelled”. Then, the user should be
  able to continue with a new command.
  • T - the script terminates (exiting the while loop);
  • H - a request for help from the user. The commands that the program recognises are printed
  out to the console;
  
 
  Activity 2:
   implement a binary search tree and a linked list, and compare the complexities of both structures
